## Alien Abduction form 
 
Completed: May 2016
 
### Summary:
 
In this PHP project, the main goal was to create an intake form and use PHP to validate input and send data to a database. I created the alien abduction intake form using html and css as well as using conditional statements and functions for validation. 

### What I learned:

I learned how to set-up and assign variables, create errors messages and make inputs "sticky" -- for example -- if you fill out the form and forget to put a valid email address, the form will not submit and an error message will appear. I also learned how to sanitize data and help prevent XSS attacks.
